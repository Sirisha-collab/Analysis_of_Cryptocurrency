INTRODUCTION:
There are two primary methods used to make investment decisions:

Fundamental analysis involves analyzing a companyâ€™s financial statements to determine the fair value of the business
Technical analysis attempts to understand the market sentiment behind price trends by looking for patterns and trends to determine future price movements.
The price of an asset reflects the sum total knowledge of all market participants; their analysis, views and actions.
